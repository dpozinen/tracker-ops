# Tracker Ops

A proxy service to search trackers (currently only 1337x.to) without
ads, popups and through a unified sleek UI.

Also due to the messed up nature of my TrueNAS setup & Mac OS ""security"" features - magnet links do not getting "magneted" to deluge. This provides a dedicated
config and button for manual deluge magnet handling
